# 🐧 Interactive Linux Command Tutor (Basic I & II)

This project is an **interactive Bash-based quiz script** that helps students **practice and test their knowledge of Linux shell commands** taught in **Basic Command I & II**.

The script asks questions one by one, takes the user's input, and checks for **exact command matches**, providing instant feedback and a final score.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Help students **practice Linux commands interactively**
- Enforce **exact command syntax**
- Strengthen command-line memory through repetition
- Provide a **simple terminal-based learning tool**

## 🛠 Tool Used

- **Bash Shell (Linux Terminal)**

## 🖥 Setting Up Kali Linux Using VMware Player (Student Version)

1. First, download **VMware Player** (latest version) from the internet.  
   If you are using **Windows or Linux**, use **VMware Player**.  
   If you are using **Mac**, use **VMware Fusion Player**.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
## ✅ Project Steps (Student Version)

1. We installed **Kali Linux using VMware Player** on our computers.  

2. After logging into Kali, we opened the **Terminal** using:  
CTRL + ALT + T  

3. We created a new Bash script file using this command:  
```bash
touch Project.sh
```
4. We opened the file using the mousepad editor:

```bash
mousepad Project.sh
```

5. We wrote our code, saved the file and closed the editor.

6. We gave the script permission to run using:

```bash
chmod +x Project.sh
```
7. We ran the script using:

```bash

./Project.sh
```
8. The program started showing Linux command questions.
